# 🚀 GitHub Deployment Guide

## Quick GitHub Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click "New repository"
2. Repository name: `orphichain-pwa`
3. Description: `Decentralized Network PWA with Web3 Integration`
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/orphichain-pwa.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

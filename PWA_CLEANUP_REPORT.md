### 🗑️ **Files Removed:**

1. **`/public/sw.js`** - Service Worker causing fetch errors
2. **`/src/PWAManager.js`** - PWA Manager causing import conflicts  
3. **`/public/manifest.json`** - PWA Manifest with incorrect configurations
4. **`/public/clear-cache.js`** - Cache management script with service worker dependencies
5. **`/vite.config.js`** - Complex configuration replaced with simple version

### 🔧 **Files Modified:**

1. **`/src/services/NotificationService.js`** - Removed service worker dependencies
   - Simplified initialization to use basic Notification API

```javascript
// vite.config.js - Simplified
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 5175,
    hmr: { port: 5175 }

## Current Status
✅ **LeadFive Contract Deployed Successfully**
- **Proxy Contract**: `0x86CCF0eb67a7aB09234d5F4aE265F9eFB8E8fb6c`
- **Implementation**: `0xc58620dd8fD9d244453e421E700c2D3FCFB595b4`

## Required Action: Secure Private Key Setup

To complete the ownership transfer, you need to add your deployer wallet's private key to the environment:

### Step 1: Add Private Key Securely
```bash
# Open the .env file
nano .env

# Find the line:
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Replace with your actual private key (no 0x prefix):
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_64_character_private_key_here
```

### Step 2: Execute Ownership Transfer
```bash
# Once private key is set, run the transfer script:
npx hardhat run transfer-ownership-to-trezor.cjs --network bsc
```

## Security Checklist Before Transfer

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY VERIFICATION**:

1. **✅ Verify Trezor Address**: Confirm `0xDf628ed21f0B27197Ad02fc29EbF4417C04c4D29` is your Trezor
2. **✅ Test Trezor Access**: Ensure you can access this address with your Trezor device
3. **✅ Backup Verification**: Confirm you have your Trezor seed phrase securely stored
4. **✅ Network Verification**: Script will verify BSC Mainnet (Chain ID: 56)

## What the Transfer Script Does

1. **Verification Phase**:
   - ✅ Confirms BSC Mainnet network
   - ✅ Verifies current ownership
   - ✅ Validates target Trezor address
   - ✅ Shows security checkpoint

2. **Transfer Phase**:
   - 🔄 Executes `transferOwnership()` transaction
   - ⏳ Waits for confirmation
   - ✅ Verifies ownership change
   - 📄 Saves transfer record

3. **Post-Transfer**:
   - 🔍 Tests admin access status
   - 📋 Creates ownership record
   - 📊 Provides BSCScan links

## Expected Output

## After Transfer Complete

Once ownership is transferred:

## Troubleshooting

**If transfer fails**:
- Verify private key format (64 hex characters, no 0x prefix)
- Ensure sufficient BNB for gas fees
- Check network connection
- Verify current ownership status

**Common Error Solutions**:
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'address')` → Private key not set
- `revert` → Insufficient permissions or invalid address
- `network error` → Check RPC URL and internet connection

**⚠️ REMEMBER**: This action is **IRREVERSIBLE**. After transfer, only the Trezor wallet can control the contract.

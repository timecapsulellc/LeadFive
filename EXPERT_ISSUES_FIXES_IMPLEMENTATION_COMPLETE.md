# ðŸš€ Expert Issues Fixes Implementation Complete

## âœ… Issues Fixed Successfully

### 1. WebSocket URL Configuration (CRITICAL) âœ…
**Issue**: WebSocket URL was hardcoded to `ws://localhost:8080` which won't work in production.

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Added environment variables to `.env`:
  - `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://ws.leadfive.today`
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.leadfive.today`
  - `VITE_SENTRY_DSN=` (for error tracking)

- âœ… Updated `src/services/WebSocketService.js`:
  - Replaced hardcoded URL with environment variable logic
  - Added fallback logic: `import.meta.env.VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL || (import.meta.env.DEV ? 'ws://localhost:8080' : 'wss://ws.leadfive.today')`
  - Maintains development functionality while enabling production deployment

### 2. Genealogy Tree Colors & Visibility âœ…
**Issue**: Colors were not clearly visible or matching the brand.

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Updated `src/components/GenealogyTree.css`:
  - Changed main container background to LeadFive brand colors: `linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a2e 0%, #16213e 50%, #0f3460 100%)`
  - Added golden border: `border: 2px solid #FFD700`
  - Enhanced box shadow: `box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.2)`
  - Updated legend colors with glowing effects:
    - Premium: `#FFD700` with glow
    - Advanced: `#FF6B35` with glow  
    - Standard: `#00D4FF` with glow
    - Entry: `#10B981` with glow

### 3. Dashboard "Network Tree" Navigation âœ…
**Issue**: The left sidebar "Network Tree" menu item wasn't navigating correctly.

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Verified routing in `src/App.jsx` - `/genealogy` route exists and works correctly
- âœ… Enhanced `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`:
  - Added "Full Network View" button in Network section
  - Button navigates to `/genealogy` for complete tree view
  - Maintains internal dashboard network view while providing access to full genealogy page
- âœ… Added CSS styling in `src/pages/Dashboard.css`:
  - `.section-actions` container for button layout
  - `.full-view-btn` with LeadFive brand styling and hover effects

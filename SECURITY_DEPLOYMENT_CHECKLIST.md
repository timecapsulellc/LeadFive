## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Run Security Validation**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/security-validation.cjs --network bsc
```
> ‚úÖ Must show "SECURITY VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL" before proceeding

### **Step 2: Execute Mainnet Deployment**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mainnet-comprehensive.cjs --network bsc
```

### **Step 3: Verify Contract on BSCScan**
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network bsc [CONTRACT_ADDRESS] \
  "0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955" \
  "0xD29ef4aE187AB9E07B7E0839CF64508A3D70A229" \
  "0xD29ef4aE187AB9E07B7E0839CF64508A3D70A229" \
  "0xD29ef4aE187AB9E07B7E0839CF64508A3D70A229"
```

## üîí Post-Deployment Security Actions

### **Immediate Actions (Within 5 minutes)**
1. **Transfer Admin Rights**
   - Transfer contract ownership to MetaMask wallet
   - Grant all admin roles to MetaMask wallet
   - Revoke all deployer privileges

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check contract is verified on BSCScan
   - Test basic contract functions
   - Confirm ownership transfer completed

3. **Secure Private Keys**
   - Delete `.env` file or encrypt it
   - Remove private keys from any devices
   - Store hardware wallet securely

### **Security Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check contract owner
npx hardhat run scripts/check-contract-ownership.cjs --network bsc

# Verify all admin roles
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-admin-roles.cjs --network bsc
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### **If Deployment Fails**
1. **Check Error Logs**
   - Review deployment error details
   - Check gas fees and network status
   - Verify wallet balance and connectivity

2. **Retry Deployment**
   - Increase gas limit if needed
   - Try alternative RPC endpoints
   - Use backup deployer wallet if necessary

### **If Security Breach Detected**
1. **Emergency Pause** (if contract is deployed)
   ```bash
   # Using MetaMask wallet
   contract.emergencyPause()
   ```

2. **Contact Security Team**
   - Document the security issue
   - Implement immediate mitigation
   - Plan security patch deployment

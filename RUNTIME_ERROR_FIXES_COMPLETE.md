# Runtime Error Fixes - Complete Report

## Overview
This document details the resolution of critical runtime errors that were affecting the LeadFive dashboard user experience.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. QuickWithdrawalCard Infinite Render Loop ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Maximum update depth exceeded error
- Caused by setState being called repeatedly in useEffect
- Dependencies array included entire `balances` object causing constant re-renders

**Root Cause:**
```jsx
// BEFORE (Problematic)
useEffect(() => {
  if (balances?.available) {
    // ... generate suggestions
    setWithdrawalSuggestions(suggestions.slice(0, 4));
  }
}, [balances]); // Full object dependency causing constant updates
```

**Solution Applied:**
```jsx
// AFTER (Fixed)
useEffect(() => {
  if (balances?.available) {
    // ... generate suggestions
    const newSuggestions = suggestions.slice(0, 4);
    
    // Only update if suggestions have actually changed
    setWithdrawalSuggestions(prevSuggestions => {
      if (JSON.stringify(prevSuggestions) !== JSON.stringify(newSuggestions)) {
        return newSuggestions;
      }
      return prevSuggestions;
    });
  } else {
    setWithdrawalSuggestions([]);
  }
}, [balances?.available]); // Only depend on the specific value that changes
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminated infinite render loop
- ✅ Improved performance and stability
- ✅ Proper dependency management

### 2. UnifiedChatbot JSX Attribute Warning ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- React warning: "jsx should be a string, not a boolean"
- Caused by styled-jsx inline styling in component

**Root Cause:**
```jsx
// BEFORE (Problematic)
<style jsx>{`
  @keyframes typing {
    0%, 60%, 100% {
      transform: translateY(0);
    }
    30% {
      transform: translateY(-10px);
    }
  }
`}</style>
```

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Removed inline styled-jsx** from component
2. **Moved animation to CSS file** (`/src/styles/UnifiedChatbot.css`)

```css
/* Added to UnifiedChatbot.css */
@keyframes typing {
  0%, 60%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  30% {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminated React warnings
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Cleaner component code

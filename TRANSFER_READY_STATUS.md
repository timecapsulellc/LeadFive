## 🔐 What Happens During Transfer

1. **Pre-Transfer Verification**:
   - ✅ Confirms BSC Mainnet connection
   - ✅ Verifies current deployer ownership
   - ✅ Validates Trezor address format
   - ✅ Shows security checkpoint

2. **Secure Transfer Process**:
   - 🔄 Executes `transferOwnership(0xDf628ed21f0B27197Ad02fc29EbF4417C04c4D29)`
   - ⏳ Waits for blockchain confirmation
   - ✅ Verifies ownership change completed
   - 📄 Creates permanent transfer record

3. **Post-Transfer Verification**:
   - 🔍 Confirms new owner is Trezor
   - 🔑 Checks admin access status
   - 📊 Provides BSCScan verification links

## 🎉 After Transfer Complete

**Immediate Results**:
- 🔐 **Enhanced Security**: Only Trezor hardware wallet can control contract
- 🚫 **Deployer Access**: Original deployer loses admin privileges
- ✅ **Irreversible**: Transfer cannot be undone
- 📋 **Documentation**: Transfer record saved to `ownership-transfer-record.json`

**Next Steps**:
1. **Test Trezor Access**: Connect to BSCScan and verify admin functions
2. **Security Cleanup**: Remove private key from `.env` file
3. **Launch Preparation**: Begin user onboarding and marketing
4. **Monitoring**: Set up post-launch analytics

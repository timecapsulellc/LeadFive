## üö® CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

### 1. **Fund Deployer Wallet**
```bash
# Send at least 0.2 BNB to:
0x6CCF588dBA15134d7b3647F8237183958Ae87647
```

### 2. **Create Secure .env File**
```bash
# Copy template and fill with your values:
cp .env.metamask.template .env

# Edit .env with your actual values:
# - DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY (from MetaMask)
# - BSCSCAN_API_KEY (from bscscan.com)
# - Other configuration values
```

### 3. **Export MetaMask Private Key**
```
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click on Account Details
3. Click "Export Private Key"
4. Enter your MetaMask password
5. Copy the private key (without 0x prefix)
6. Paste into .env file as DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è DELETE FROM METAMASK AFTER DEPLOYMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

### 4. **Run Security Validation**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/metamask-security-validation.cjs --network bsc
```

### 5. **Deploy to Mainnet**
```bash
# Only run this AFTER validation passes:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mainnet-comprehensive.cjs --network bsc
```

## üõ°Ô∏è POST-DEPLOYMENT SECURITY ACTIONS

### 1. **Immediate Actions (Within 5 minutes)**
- [ ] Transfer all admin rights to MetaMask admin: `0xD29ef4aE187AB9E07B7E0839CF64508A3D70A229`
- [ ] Revoke all deployer privileges from: `0x6CCF588dBA15134d7b3647F8237183958Ae87647`
- [ ] Verify contract on BSCScan
- [ ] Test basic contract functions

### 2. **Security Cleanup**
- [ ] Delete `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` from `.env` file
- [ ] Clear MetaMask private key from clipboard/memory
- [ ] Backup deployment artifacts securely
- [ ] Document contract address and admin procedures

### 3. **Verification Steps**
- [ ] Confirm contract owner is MetaMask admin address
- [ ] Verify deployer has no admin roles
- [ ] Test admin functions with MetaMask admin wallet
- [ ] Confirm USDT integration works correctly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNINGS

### üî¥ NEVER DO THIS:
- ‚ùå Commit `.env` files to git
- ‚ùå Share private keys in chat/email
- ‚ùå Use the same private key on multiple networks
- ‚ùå Skip the ownership transfer step
- ‚ùå Deploy without sufficient BNB balance

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS:
- ‚úÖ Validate everything before deployment
- ‚úÖ Transfer ownership immediately after deployment
- ‚úÖ Verify contracts on BSCScan
- ‚úÖ Test all functions before going live
- ‚úÖ Backup deployment data securely

---

## üìû EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Deployment Fails:
1. Check gas price and network congestion
2. Verify deployer has sufficient BNB
3. Confirm network connectivity
4. Check for smart contract compilation errors
5. Retry with higher gas price if needed

### If Private Key is Compromised:
1. Immediately transfer all funds to a new wallet
2. Revoke any contract permissions
3. Update deployment configuration
4. Generate new private keys

### If Admin Rights Transfer Fails:
1. Check MetaMask admin address is correct
2. Verify contract is not paused
3. Ensure sufficient gas for transaction
4. Try transferring individual roles separately

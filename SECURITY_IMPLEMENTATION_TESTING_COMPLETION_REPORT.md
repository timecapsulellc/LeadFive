## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### **MEV Protection System**
```solidity
modifier mevProtection() {
    if (mevProtectionEnabled) {
        require(block.number > lastActionBlock[msg.sender] + MIN_BLOCK_DELAY, 
               "MEV protection active");
        lastActionBlock[msg.sender] = block.number;
    }
    _;
}
```

### **Circuit Breaker Implementation**
```solidity
modifier circuitBreakerCheck(uint256 amount) {
    if (circuitBreakerEnabled) {
        _resetDailyWithdrawalsIfNeeded();
        require(currentDayWithdrawals + amount <= maxDailyWithdrawals, 
               "Daily limit exceeded");
        currentDayWithdrawals += amount;
    }
    _;
}
```

### **Reentrancy Protection**
```solidity
function withdraw() 
    external 
    whenNotPaused 
    mevProtection 
    nonReentrant 
    circuitBreakerCheck(users[msg.sender].withdrawableAmount)
{
    // CEI Pattern Implementation
    uint256 amount = users[msg.sender].withdrawableAmount;
    users[msg.sender].withdrawableAmount = 0; // Effects first
    require(usdtToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount), "Transfer failed"); // Interactions last
}
```

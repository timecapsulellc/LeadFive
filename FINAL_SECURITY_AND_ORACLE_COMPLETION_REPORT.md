contract ChainlinkPriceOracle is IPriceOracle {
    mapping(address => AggregatorV3Interface) public priceFeeds;
    
    function getPrice(address token) external view returns (uint256) {
        // Chainlink price feed integration
        // Stale price protection
        // Price deviation monitoring
    }
    
    function isHealthy() external view returns (bool) {
        // Multi-feed health validation
    }
}
```

#### **Security Features Planned**
1. **Stale Price Protection** - 1-hour maximum age
2. **Price Deviation Monitoring** - 10% maximum deviation
3. **Circuit Breaker** - Emergency pause mechanism

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ "Insufficient funds for intrinsic transaction cost"
**Solution**: Add more BNB to deployer wallet (minimum 0.15 BNB)

#### ❌ "User rejected transaction"
**Solution**: Confirm transaction on hardware wallet (Trezor)

#### ❌ "Contract verification failed"
**Solution**: Manually verify on BSCScan using provided command

#### ❌ "Network connection failed"
**Solution**: Check BSC Mainnet RPC URL and connection

#### ❌ "Contract address mismatch"
**Solution**: Update contract address in verification scripts

### Gas Price Optimization

**Monitor Gas Prices:**
- Use BSC gas trackers
- Deploy during off-peak hours (2-8 UTC)
- Consider gas price alerts

**Optimal Deployment Times:**
- **Best**: 02:00-08:00 UTC (Low activity)
- **Good**: 08:00-14:00 UTC (Moderate activity)
- **Avoid**: 22:00-02:00 UTC (Peak activity)

# RealTimeDashboard Syntax Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Issue Resolution Summary

Successfully resolved all compilation errors in the RealTimeDashboard.jsx component that were preventing the OrphiChain PWA from building and running properly.

## 🔧 Errors Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Function Declarations ✅
**Issue:** Multiple declarations of `setupHeartbeat` and `scheduleReconnect` functions
**Resolution:** 
- Removed duplicate `setupHeartbeat` function at line 225
- Removed duplicate `scheduleReconnect` function at line 257
- Kept the properly structured versions later in the file

### 2. Incomplete Function Structure ✅
**Issue:** Malformed `setupContractEvents` function with missing try-catch completion
**Resolution:**
- Added proper try-catch completion for `setupContractEvents` function
- Included error handling and fallback data generation call
- Fixed dependencies array for useCallback

### 3. Malformed setState Calls ✅
**Issue:** Incomplete state update call with orphaned spread operator
**Resolution:**
- Fixed broken state update structure in contract event handlers
- Properly structured `setRealtimeData` calls with complete object syntax
- Added missing function context for event handlers

### 4. Async/Await Context Error ✅
**Issue:** `await` expression used in non-async context for block number retrieval
**Resolution:**
- Extracted `await contract.provider.getBlockNumber()` to separate variable
- Called it before the state update to maintain proper async context
- Ensured clean separation of async operations

## 📁 Files Modified

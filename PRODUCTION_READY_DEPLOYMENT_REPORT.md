## 🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR MAINNET DEPLOYMENT

### 🎯 Immediate Requirements (Before Mainnet)
1. **Root User Registration**: Set up admin mechanism to register first user
2. **Real User Flow Testing**: Test actual registration with multiple test accounts
3. **Bonus Distribution Testing**: Verify real USDT transfers and bonus calculations
4. **Withdrawal Testing**: Test withdrawal functionality with real transactions
5. **Frontend Integration**: Connect UI to smart contract

### 🔧 Technical Preparation
1. **Update .env for Mainnet**:
   - Set `NETWORK=bsc-mainnet`
   - Use `USDT_MAINNET=0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955`
   - Ensure sufficient BNB for deployment gas fees

2. **Deployment Process**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployTestnet.cjs --network bsc_mainnet
   npx hardhat verify --network bsc_mainnet <proxy_address>
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment Security**:
   - Transfer all admin roles to MetaMask wallet
   - Revoke deployer wallet permissions
   - Test all admin functions from MetaMask

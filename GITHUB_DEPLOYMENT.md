# GitHub Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to upload the Orphi CrowdFund smart contract system to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" button in the top-right corner and select "New repository"

5. Choose "Public" or "Private" depending on your preference
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Configure your Git identity (if you haven't already)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com

# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/orphi-crowdfund.git

# Push the main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Repository Content

1. After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page
2. Ensure all files are uploaded correctly
3. Check that no sensitive information is visible in any files
4. Verify that the GitHub Actions workflow is configured correctly

## 4. Set Up Branch Protection (Optional)

For better security, set up branch protection rules:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" > "Branches"
3. Click "Add rule" under "Branch protection rules"
4. Enter "main" as the branch name pattern
5. Check "Require pull request reviews before merging"
6. Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
7. Check "Require signed commits"
8. Click "Create"

## 5. Enable Security Features

1. Go to "Settings" > "Security" > "Code security and analysis"
2. Enable "Dependency graph"

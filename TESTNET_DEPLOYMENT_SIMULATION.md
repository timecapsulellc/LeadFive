## 🛠️ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

Due to Node.js version compatibility issues with the current environment, 
here are the manual steps to complete the testnet deployment:

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure you have Node.js 18.x or 20.x (not 23.x)
nvm use 18  # or install Node.js 18.x

# Verify Hardhat compatibility
npx hardhat --version
```

### Step 2: Fund Testnet Account
1. Get testnet BNB from: https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart
2. Fund address: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
3. Minimum required: 0.1 BNB for deployment

### Step 3: Execute Deployment
```bash
cd "/Users/dadou/Orphi CrowdFund"
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-simple-testnet.cjs --network bsc_testnet
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
After successful deployment:
1. ✅ Contract deployed with all security features active
2. ✅ Mock USDT deployed for testing
3. ✅ All initialization parameters set correctly
4. ✅ Security features verified on-chain

# 🔐 LeadFive Credential Encryption Complete

## ✅ Security Status: SECURED

All sensitive credentials in your LeadFive project have been successfully encrypted and secured:

### 🔒 Encrypted Credentials
- ✅ **Private Key**: `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` → `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED`
- ✅ **BSC API Key**: `BSCSCAN_API_KEY` → `BSCSCAN_API_KEY_ENCRYPTED`
- ✅ **Security Audit**: PASSED - No plaintext credentials detected

### 🛠️ Available Tools

#### 1. Encryption Tools
- `scripts/encrypt-env.cjs` - Encrypt private keys in .env file
- `scripts/encrypt-api-key.cjs` - Encrypt BSC API keys

#### 2. Decryption Tools
- `scripts/decrypt-env.cjs` - Decrypt all credentials for deployment

#### 3. Security Tools
- `scripts/security-audit.cjs` - Verify no credentials are exposed

### 🚀 Usage Instructions

#### For Deployment (Decrypt Credentials)
```bash
# Get your decrypted credentials for deployment
node scripts/decrypt-env.cjs
```
This will output both your private key and BSC API key that you can use in deployment scripts.

#### Security Audit
```bash
# Verify all credentials are encrypted
node scripts/security-audit.cjs
```

❌ No plaintext credentials remain
```

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC encryption with password protection
2. **No Plaintext**: All sensitive credentials removed from .env
3. **Audit Trail**: Security audit tool to verify encryption
4. **Separate Tools**: Dedicated encryption/decryption utilities
5. **Strong Passwords**: Minimum 8-character requirement

### ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **Password Management**: Remember your encryption password - it's required for deployment
2. **Git Safety**: .env file is already in .gitignore - never commit it
3. **Credential Rotation**: Rotate both private key and API key after mainnet deployment
4. **Access Control**: Only use decryption tool when needed for deployment

### 🔄 Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Decrypt credentials**: Use `scripts/decrypt-env.cjs` when ready to deploy
2. **Copy credentials**: Temporarily copy decrypted values for deployment scripts
3. **Deploy securely**: Use the deployment scripts with decrypted credentials
4. **Clean up**: Remove any temporary plaintext credentials after deployment
5. **Rotate keys**: Generate new credentials and re-encrypt after successful deployment

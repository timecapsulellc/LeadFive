## üîß **DNS CONFIGURATION REQUIRED**

### **Step 1: Add Domain to DigitalOcean App**
1. Go to DigitalOcean App Platform
2. Select your LeadFive app
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
4. Click "Add Domain"
5. Enter: `leadfive.today`
6. Click "Add Domain"

### **Step 2: Configure DNS Records**
Add these DNS records at your domain registrar (where you bought leadfive.today):

```dns
Type: CNAME
Name: @  (or leave blank for root domain)
Value: leadfive-app-3f8tb.ondigitalocean.app
TTL: 300 (or automatic)

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: leadfive-app-3f8tb.ondigitalocean.app
TTL: 300 (or automatic)
```

### **Step 3: Verify DNS Propagation**
After adding DNS records, check propagation:
```bash
# Check DNS propagation
nslookup leadfive.today
dig leadfive.today CNAME

# Should return: leadfive-app-3f8tb.ondigitalocean.app
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è **EXPECTED TIMELINE**
- **DNS Propagation**: 15 minutes - 24 hours
- **SSL Certificate**: Automatic after DNS resolves
- **Domain Active**: Usually within 1-2 hours

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**
1. **DNS Not Propagating**: Wait up to 24 hours
2. **SSL Certificate Pending**: Wait for DNS to fully propagate
3. **404 Error**: Check CNAME record points to correct DigitalOcean URL

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Test if domain resolves
curl -I https://leadfive.today

# Check CNAME record
dig leadfive.today CNAME

# Check from different locations
nslookup leadfive.today 8.8.8.8
```

## Revenue Impact Analysis

### What's Happening

3. Contract tries to send admin fee to zero address
4. **FUNDS ARE PERMANENTLY LOST** (burned)
5. User receives 95% of their withdrawal

### Immediate Action Required
You need to set the admin fee recipient to your Trezor wallet **immediately** to start collecting platform revenue.

## How to Fix (Step-by-Step)

### Method 1: BSCScan Web Interface (Recommended)

   ```

### Method 2: Script (Alternative)
```bash
# Create admin setup script
node scripts/setup-admin-fee.cjs
```

## Contract Functions Affected

### Functions That Collect Admin Fees
1. `withdrawBalance()` - Direct withdrawals
2. `withdrawFromPool()` - Pool withdrawals
3. Both functions currently burn 5% of all withdrawals!

### Admin Fee Flow
```

## Technical Details

### Contract State Check
```javascript
// Current state
adminFeeRecipient = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
ADMIN_FEE_RATE = 500 (5%)
totalAdminFeesCollected = 0 (all burned)

// Required state
adminFeeRecipient = 0xDf628ed21f0B27197Ad02fc29EbF4417C04c4D29
ADMIN_FEE_RATE = 500 (5%) // unchanged
totalAdminFeesCollected = accumulating
```

   - Should show your Trezor address

3. **Test Revenue Collection:**

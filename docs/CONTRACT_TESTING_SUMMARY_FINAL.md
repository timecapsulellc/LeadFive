## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS FOR FULL TESTING**

### **Option 1: Get Testnet USDT (Recommended)**

1. **Get BSC Testnet USDT**:
   ```
   Testnet USDT Contract: 0x7ef95a0FEE0Dd31b22626fA2e10Ee6A223F8a684
   
   Sources for Testnet USDT:
   - BSC Testnet Faucets
   - Testnet DEX swaps
   - Community testnet USDT faucets
   ```

2. **Test Complete Registration Flow**:
   - Approve USDT spending
   - Register user with package payment
   - Test referral system
   - Test withdrawals

### **Option 2: Deploy Mock USDT (Quick Testing)**

I can create a mock USDT contract that allows free minting for testing:

```bash
# Deploy mock USDT with free minting
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mock-usdt.cjs --network bscTestnet
```

### **Option 3: Frontend Integration (Parallel Track)**

While setting up USDT, you can proceed with frontend integration:

1. **Update Frontend Contract Address**: `0x1E95943b022dde7Ce7e0F54ced25599e0c6D8b9b`
2. **Test Read Functions**: All view functions are working
3. **Setup Web3 Connection**: BSC Testnet integration
4. **Prepare Payment Flow**: USDT approval + registration

# Orphi CrowdFund Security Guidelines

## Security Best Practices

### Development Environment
- **Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub**
- Always use the `.env.example` as a template
- Keep private keys and API keys secure
- Use different accounts for testing and production

### Deployment Security
- Use multi-signature wallets for production admin roles
- Verify contract source code on BSCScan after deployment
- Run the full security audit before mainnet deployment
- Implement proper timelock for administrative functions

### Contract Interactions
- Test all administrative functions on testnet first
- Use hardware wallets for production deployments
- Keep deployment addresses documented securely
- Rotate admin keys periodically

## Security Features

The Orphi CrowdFund contracts implement several security features:

1. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with OpenZeppelin AccessControl
2. **Reentrancy Protection**: ReentrancyGuard on all critical functions
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Emergency pause functionality
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
5. **Economic Security**: 4x earnings cap with automatic reinvestment

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing (58/58)
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Gas optimization verified (8% improvement in V2)
- [ ] Multi-sig wallet configured for admin functions
- [ ] BSC testnet deployment validated
- [ ] Production deployment parameters verified
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented

## Emergency Response Plan

1. **Pause Contract**: Use `emergencyPause()` function
2. **Contact Team**: Alert all stakeholders
3. **Assess Situation**: Determine severity and impact
4. **Implement Fix**: Deploy patched implementation if needed
5. **Resume Operations**: Use `emergencyUnpause()` function

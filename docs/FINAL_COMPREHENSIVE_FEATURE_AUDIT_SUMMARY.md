## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**

### **✅ CRITICAL FIX #1: Admin Fee Timing Correction**
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

**Implementation:**
```solidity
// ✅ FIXED: Admin fee calculated and collected first
uint96 adminFee = CommissionLib.calculateAdminFee(packagePrice, ADMIN_FEE_RATE);
uint96 distributableAmount = packagePrice - adminFee;
totalAdminFeesCollected += adminFee;
return distributableAmount; // Only 95% distributed
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ $200 package → $10 admin fee (exactly 5%)
- ✅ $190 available for distribution (exactly 95%)
- ✅ All package levels working correctly

### **✅ CRITICAL FIX #2: Matrix Spillover Rotation**
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

**Implementation:**
```solidity
// ✅ FIXED: Spillover rotation for fairness
mapping(address => uint32) public spilloverCounter;
uint8 spilloverDirection = uint8(spilloverCounter[current] % 2);
spilloverCounter[current]++;
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Left/right positions filled alternately
- ✅ Spillover counter incrementing correctly
- ✅ Balanced matrix distribution achieved

### **✅ CRITICAL FIX #3: Gas Limit Protection**
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

**Implementation:**
```solidity
// ✅ FIXED: Gas monitoring and protection
event GasLimitReached(address indexed user, uint8 level, string bonusType);

if(gasleft() < gasLimit / 10) {
    emit GasLimitReached(user, i, "LevelBonus");
    break;
}
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Gas monitoring events defined
- ✅ Protection logic implemented
- ✅ Deep referral chains handled without reverting

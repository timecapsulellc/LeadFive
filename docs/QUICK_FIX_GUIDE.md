# ⚡ QUICK FIX - 3 STEPS TO DEPLOY CORRECT CONTRACT

## 🎯 PROBLEM: Missing Features = Lost Revenue

Your current contract is missing:
- ❌ **5% Admin Fees** (you're losing money!)
- ❌ **Pool Systems** (no incentives)

## ✅ SOLUTION: 3 Simple Steps

### **STEP 1: Add Your Private Key**

```

**How to get private key:**
- MetaMask: Account Details → Export Private Key
- Need 0.05+ BNB in this wallet

### **STEP 2: Run Deployment**
```bash
npm run deploy:correct
```

### **STEP 3: Update Frontend**
```bash
# Copy new contract address from deployment output
# Update src/config/app.js with new address
```

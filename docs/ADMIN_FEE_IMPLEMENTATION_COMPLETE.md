# ðŸŽ‰ 5% ADMIN WITHDRAWAL FEE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## âœ… **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The 5% admin withdrawal fee has been successfully implemented in the LeadFive contract while maintaining the 100% compensation plan integrity.

---

## ðŸ”§ **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **ðŸ“‹ Smart Contract Changes**

#### **1. Added Admin Fee Constants**
```solidity
uint256 private constant ADMIN_FEE_RATE = 500; // 5% in basis points
address public adminFeeRecipient;
uint96 public totalAdminFeesCollected;
```

#### **2. Enhanced Withdrawal Function**
```solidity
function withdraw(uint96 amount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    User storage user = users[msg.sender];
    require(user.isRegistered && !user.isBlacklisted, "Invalid user");
    require(amount <= user.balance, "Insufficient balance");
    require(adminFeeRecipient != address(0), "Admin fee recipient not set");
    
    // PDF Specification: Progressive withdrawal based on direct referrals
    uint8 withdrawalRate = _getProgressiveWithdrawalRate(user.directReferrals);
    uint96 withdrawable = (amount * withdrawalRate) / 100;
    uint96 reinvestment = amount - withdrawable;
    
    // Calculate 5% admin fee from withdrawable amount
    uint96 adminFee = uint96((withdrawable * ADMIN_FEE_RATE) / BASIS_POINTS);
    uint96 userReceives = withdrawable - adminFee;
    
    user.balance -= amount;
    totalAdminFeesCollected += adminFee;
    
    // Transfer to user (95% of withdrawable amount)
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(userReceives);
    
    // Transfer admin fee (5% of withdrawable amount)
    payable(adminFeeRecipient).transfer(adminFee);
    
    // Handle reinvestment distribution (unchanged)
    if(reinvestment > 0) {
        _distributeReinvestment(msg.sender, reinvestment);
    }
    
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, userReceives);
    emit AdminFeeCollected(adminFee, msg.sender);
}
```

#### **3. Admin Fee Management Functions**
```solidity
function setAdminFeeRecipient(address _recipient) external onlyOwner {
    require(_recipient != address(0), "Invalid address");
    adminFeeRecipient = _recipient;
    emit AdminFeeRecipientUpdated(_recipient);
}

function getAdminFeeInfo() external view returns (
    address recipient,
    uint96 totalCollected,
    uint256 feeRate
) {
    return (
        adminFeeRecipient,
        totalAdminFeesCollected,
        ADMIN_FEE_RATE
    );
}

function calculateWithdrawalBreakdown(address user, uint96 amount) external view returns (
    uint96 withdrawable,
    uint96 adminFee,
    uint96 userReceives,
    uint96 reinvestment,
    uint8 withdrawalRate
) {
    require(users[user].isRegistered, "User not registered");
    
    withdrawalRate = _getProgressiveWithdrawalRate(users[user].directReferrals);
    withdrawable = (amount * withdrawalRate) / 100;
    reinvestment = amount - withdrawable;
    adminFee = uint96((withdrawable * ADMIN_FEE_RATE) / BASIS_POINTS);
    userReceives = withdrawable - adminFee;
    
    return (withdrawable, adminFee, userReceives, reinvestment, withdrawalRate);
}
```

#### **4. New Events**
```solidity
event AdminFeeCollected(uint96 amount, address indexed user);
event AdminFeeRecipientUpdated(address indexed newRecipient);
```

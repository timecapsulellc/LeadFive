# 🔧 Error Fixed - WebSocket Service Issue Resolved

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Fixed**

The error was caused by a missing method in our custom `SimpleEventEmitter` implementation.

### **Error Details:**
```
TypeError: WebSocketService.removeListener is not a function
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `RealtimeStatus` component was trying to call `WebSocketService.removeListener()` during cleanup, but our custom `SimpleEventEmitter` only had the `off()` method.

### **Solution Applied:**
Added the missing `removeListener()` method as an alias to `off()` in the WebSocket service:

```javascript
removeListener(event, listener) {
  this.off(event, listener);
}
```

## 🎯 **Current Status:**

### ✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- WebSocket service method compatibility
- Error boundary is working correctly (showing beautiful error page)
- Custom EventEmitter now has full compatibility

### ✅ **Application Features Working:**
- Error boundary protection is active

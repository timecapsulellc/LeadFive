## âœ… **OPTIMIZED GAS REQUIREMENTS**

### **Deployment Costs:**
- **Contract Deployment:** ~0.03-0.05 BNB
- **Ownership Transfer:** ~0.001-0.002 BNB
- **Contract Verification:** Free (BSCScan)
- **Buffer for Gas Price Fluctuations:** ~0.02-0.03 BNB

### **ðŸ“Š DEPLOYMENT BREAKDOWN:**

**What uses the most gas:**
1. **Library Deployments** (~60% of gas cost)
   - DataStructures, MatrixManagementLib, PoolDistributionLib, etc.
2. **Main Contract Deployment** (~35% of gas cost)
   - LeadFive contract with UUPS proxy
3. **Initialization** (~5% of gas cost)
   - Contract setup and configuration

### **âš¡ GAS OPTIMIZATION:**

Our deployment is optimized with:
- âœ… **Aggressive compiler optimization** (runs: 1)
- âœ… **Library modularization** (reduces main contract size)
- âœ… **UUPS proxy pattern** (efficient upgrades)
- âœ… **Optimized gas price** (5 gwei for BSC mainnet)

### **ðŸ”§ UPDATED SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:**

- **`deploy-mainnet.cjs`:** Minimum 0.05 BNB

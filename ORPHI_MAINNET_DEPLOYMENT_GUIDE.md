## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **❌ Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue: Trezor Not Detected**
```bash
# Solution:
1. Reconnect Trezor device
2. Unlock with PIN
3. Ensure Trezor Bridge is running
4. Try different USB port
```

#### **Issue: Insufficient BNB Balance**
```bash
# Solution:
1. Check current balance: should be > 0.1 BNB
2. Transfer BNB to Trezor wallet
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Retry deployment
```

#### **Issue: Network Connection Error**
```bash
# Solution:
1. Verify BSC Mainnet connection
2. Check RPC endpoint status
3. Try alternative RPC if needed
4. Ensure stable internet connection
```

#### **Issue: Gas Price Too High**
```bash
# Solution:
1. Check current BSC gas prices
2. Wait for lower gas periods
3. Adjust gas price in config if needed
4. Monitor BSC network congestion
```

### **🆘 Emergency Procedures**

#### **If Deployment Fails:**
1. **Don't panic** - funds are safe in your Trezor
2. **Check error messages** - note specific error details
3. **Verify prerequisites** - ensure all requirements met
4. **Retry deployment** - most issues are temporary
5. **Contact support** - if issues persist

#### **If Contract Deploys but Verification Fails:**
1. **Contract is still functional** - verification is optional
2. **Manual verification** - can be done later on BSCScan
3. **Use contract address** - deployment was successful
4. **Retry verification** - run verification script separately

# Dashboard Optimization Project

## Overview
The Dashboard Optimization project aims to clean and optimize the file structure of the dashboard codebase. This involves identifying and removing unused files, ensuring that only essential documentation remains, and maintaining the integrity of components without affecting functionality or design.

## Objectives
- Scan the file system for unused or orphaned files.
- Analyze project dependencies to identify unused components and dead code.
- Audit documentation to ensure only essential documents are retained.
- Execute a cleanup process based on defined rules and configurations.
- Validate the integrity of the project post-cleanup.

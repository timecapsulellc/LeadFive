## 🎯 Deploy to Digital Ocean

### **Method 1: GitHub Actions Web Interface (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/timecapsulellc/leadfive/actions

2. **Find the DigitalOcean Workflow**:

   - Click "Run workflow" green button

4. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Watch the deployment progress in real-time
   - Typical deployment time: 2-5 minutes

### **Method 2: Check Automatic Deployment**

The push to main should have triggered automatic deployment. Check if it's already running:
- Go to: https://github.com/timecapsulellc/leadfive/actions
- Look for recent "Deploy to DigitalOcean" runs

### **Method 3: Force Trigger (If needed)**

If automatic deployment didn't work, create an empty commit to trigger it:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "🚀 Force trigger DigitalOcean deployment"
git push origin main
```

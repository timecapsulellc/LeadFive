# 🚀 TESTING QUICK START GUIDE

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing your OrphiCrowdFund smart contract and dashboard with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.

---

## 🎯 PHASE 1: LOCAL TESTING (FREE)

### **Step 1: Start Local Hardhat Network**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local blockchain
npx hardhat node

# Keep this terminal running
```

### **Step 2: Run Comprehensive Local Tests**

```bash
# Terminal 2: Run complete local testing suite
npx hardhat run scripts/local-testing-suite.js --network localhost

# This will:
# ✅ Deploy complete contract locally
# ✅ Test all compensation plan features
# ✅ Validate package amounts ($30, $50, $100, $200)
# ✅ Test level bonus payments (3%, 1%, 0.5%)
# ✅ Test upline bonus payments (30 levels)
# ✅ Test withdrawal limits (70%/75%/80%)
# ✅ Test matrix structure
# ✅ Test leader ranks
# ✅ Test 4X earnings cap
# ✅ Test club pool
# ✅ Test calendar distributions
```

### **Step 3: Test Dashboard Integration Locally**

```bash
# Terminal 3: Start dashboard development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# Connect MetaMask to localhost:8545
# Import test accounts from Hardhat node
# Test complete user journey
```

## 🌐 PHASE 2: BSC TESTNET VALIDATION (LOW COST)

### **Step 1: Get BSC Testnet BNB**

Visit these faucets to get free testnet BNB:
- **Official BSC Faucet**: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
- **Alternative Faucet**: https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart

You need approximately **0.1 BNB** for complete testing.

### **Step 2: Configure Environment**

```bash
# Create .env file with your testnet private key
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here" > .env

# Make sure hardhat.config.js has BSC testnet configuration
```

### **Step 3: Run Minimal Testnet Validation**

```bash
# Deploy and test on BSC testnet (uses only 6-7 transactions)
npx hardhat run scripts/testnet-minimal-validation.js --network bscTestnet

# This will:
# ✅ Deploy contract to BSC testnet
# ✅ Test core functionality
# ✅ Validate all features
# ✅ Provide contract addresses for dashboard
```

### **Step 4: Connect Dashboard to Testnet**

```bash
# Update dashboard configuration with testnet contract addresses
# Switch MetaMask to BSC Testnet
# Test real network integration
```

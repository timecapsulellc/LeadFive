        uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
          SLACK_TITLE: "Deployment Completed"
```

### Deployment Schedule

- **Initial Deployment**: Monday, July 8, 2025 at 10:00 AM EST
- **Maintenance Window**: Sundays, 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM EST
- **Production Releases**: Every two weeks, following sprint completion

## 🔄 Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

1. **Error Rate**: > 5% of requests returning 5xx errors
2. **Latency**: > 3000ms median response time for 5 minutes
3. **Availability**: < 99.9% uptime over 5-minute period

### Manual Rollback Procedure

1. **Via DigitalOcean Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to App Platform → leadfive-production
   - Select "Deployments" tab
   - Click on the last stable deployment
   - Select "Rollback to this Deployment"

2. **Via GitHub Actions**:
   - Trigger the `rollback.yml` workflow manually
   - Select the tag version to roll back to
   - Monitor deployment logs

3. **Emergency Contact Procedure**:
   - Primary: DevOps Lead (XXX-XXX-XXXX)
   - Secondary: Lead Developer (XXX-XXX-XXXX)
   - Escalation: CTO (XXX-XXX-XXXX)

## 🔎 Monitoring & Alerting

### Core Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Alert Channel |

## 🛡️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Critical Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Contract Integration Failure** | Medium | Critical | **Prevention**: Comprehensive pre-deployment testing with contract mock.<br>**Detection**: Real-time transaction monitoring.<br>**Response**: Activate emergency banner and failover to read-only mode. |
| **DDoS Attack** | Low | High | **Prevention**: DigitalOcean DDoS protection.<br>**Detection**: Traffic anomaly monitoring.<br>**Response**: Activate rate limiting and geo-blocking rules. |
| **Database Connection Failure** | Low | Medium | **Prevention**: Connection pooling and retry logic.<br>**Detection**: Connection latency monitoring.<br>**Response**: Fall back to local storage temporarily. |
| **API Rate Limiting** | Medium | Medium | **Prevention**: Implement caching for common requests.<br>**Detection**: Monitor rate limit headers.<br>**Response**: Implement exponential backoff. |
| **Browser Compatibility Issues** | Medium | Medium | **Prevention**: Cross-browser testing.<br>**Detection**: Error tracking by browser.<br>**Response**: Serve fallback version to problematic browsers. |

### Contingency Plans for Major Incidents

1. **Complete Service Outage**:
   - Activate maintenance page with status updates
   - Notify all users via email and social channels
   - Implement emergency rollback to last stable version
   - Conduct incident review within 24 hours

2. **Data Integrity Issues**:
   - Temporarily disable write operations
   - Activate read-only mode
   - Display banner with transparent communication
   - Provide manual verification tools for users

3. **Security Breach**:
   - Activate emergency response team
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Reset affected user credentials
   - Provide transparent communication

## 📈 Post-Deployment Verification

### Critical Features to Verify

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Registration flow
   - Login process
   - Password reset
   - Wallet connection

2. **Core Business Functionality**:
   - Dashboard loading
   - Referral system
   - Earnings calculations
   - Withdrawal process

3. **Contract Interactions**:
   - Transaction signing
   - Balance checking

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

After each deployment, conduct a retrospective to identify areas for improvement in the deployment process:

1. **Deployment Speed**: Time from commit to production
2. **Error Detection**: Time to detect production issues
3. **Resolution Time**: Time to resolve production issues
4. **User Impact**: Number of affected users during deployment

Document lessons learned and update this deployment strategy accordingly.

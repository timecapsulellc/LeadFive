   - Tiered withdrawal rates (70/75/80%) maintained
   - Pool distribution logic complete
   - Algorithmic referrer chain distribution (10% to 30 participants)
   - Reinvestment allocation (40% level, 30% chain, 30% help pool)

4. **✅ Code Quality & Compilation**
   - Contract compiles successfully with no errors
   - All syntax and declaration issues resolved
   - Admin convenience functions restored
   - Complex genealogy tracking maintained

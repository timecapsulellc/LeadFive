# üîê SECURE TREZOR DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## üö® URGENT: Deploying New Secure Contract

Your previous contract `0x8F826B18096Dcf7AF4515B06Cb563475d189ab50` has been compromised. 
This guide will help you deploy a new, secure contract using your Trezor hardware wallet.

## üìã PREREQUISITES

### Hardware Requirements:
- ‚úÖ Trezor device (Model T or One)
- ‚úÖ Trezor connected and unlocked
- ‚úÖ Latest Trezor firmware installed
- ‚úÖ Trezor Bridge or Trezor Suite running

### Software Requirements:
- ‚úÖ MetaMask browser extension
- ‚úÖ Trezor connected to MetaMask ("Connect Hardware Wallet")
- ‚úÖ BSC Mainnet network configured in MetaMask
- ‚úÖ Your Trezor address `0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0` selected

### Financial Requirements:
- ‚úÖ Minimum **0.015 BNB** in your Trezor address for gas fees
- ‚úÖ Current balance check: https://bscscan.com/address/0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0

## üîß DEPLOYMENT METHOD

You have **two secure deployment options**:

### Option 1: Direct MetaMask + Trezor Deployment (Recommended)
This is the most secure method as it uses your Trezor for signing all transactions.

### Option 2: Remix IDE + Trezor (Alternative)
Use Remix IDE with MetaMask connected to your Trezor.

## üöÄ OPTION 1: COMMAND-LINE DEPLOYMENT

### Step 1: Prepare Environment
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/dadou/Orphi CrowdFund"

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Check your Trezor balance
curl -s "https://api.bscscan.com/api?module=account&action=balance&address=0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0&tag=latest&apikey=YourApiKeyToken" | jq
```

### Step 2: Configure MetaMask
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click "Connect Hardware Wallet"
3. Select "Trezor"
4. Choose your account: `0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0`
5. Switch to **BSC Mainnet** network
6. Ensure sufficient BNB balance (min 0.015 BNB)

### Step 3: Deploy New Contract
```bash
# Deploy using the secure Trezor script
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-with-trezor.js --network bscMainnet --config hardhat.mainnet.trezor.config.js
```

### Step 4: Confirm on Trezor
- Your Trezor screen will show transaction details
- **Verify the recipient address and gas amount**
- **Confirm on your Trezor device by pressing the button**
- Wait for deployment confirmation

---

## ‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

After successful deployment:

### 1. Check Contract Address
- Note the new contract address from deployment logs
- Verify on BSCScan: https://bscscan.com/address/[NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS]

### 2. Verify Ownership
```bash
# Check owner (should be your Trezor address)
npx hardhat console --network bscMainnet --config hardhat.mainnet.trezor.config.js
```

In console:
```javascript
const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("OrphiCrowdFund", "NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS");
const owner = await contract.owner();
console.log("Owner:", owner);
// Should output: 0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0
```

### 3. Verify Initial State
```javascript
const usdtToken = await contract.usdtToken();
const treasury = await contract.treasury();
console.log("USDT Token:", usdtToken);
console.log("Treasury:", treasury);
```

---

## üîß POST-DEPLOYMENT ACTIONS

### 1. Update Frontend Configuration
Update your dashboard to use the new contract address:

```javascript
// In your frontend config
const NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x[NEW_SECURE_ADDRESS]";

// Update Web3Service.js
this.contractAddress = NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
```

### 2. Verify Contract on BSCScan (Optional)
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network bscMainnet NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955" "0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0" "0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0" "0xeB652c4523f3Cf615D3F3694b14E551145953aD0"
```

### 3. Announce New Contract
Create an announcement for your users:

```
üö® IMPORTANT SECURITY UPDATE

Due to a security incident, we have deployed a new, secure contract:
‚Ä¢ Old (COMPROMISED): 0x8F826B18096Dcf7AF4515B06Cb563475d189ab50
‚Ä¢ New (SECURE): 0x[NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS]

Please DO NOT interact with the old contract.
Use only the new contract address for all future transactions.
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY NOTES

### ‚úÖ What This Deployment Achieves:
- New contract owned by your secure Trezor wallet
- No connection to the compromised deployer wallet
- All admin functions controlled by your Trezor
- Fresh start with clean ownership

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders:
- Never use the compromised wallet `0x7FB9622c6b2480Fd75b611b87b16c556A10baA01` again
- Always verify transaction details on your Trezor screen
- Keep your Trezor firmware updated
- Store your Trezor recovery seed securely

### üîç Migration Considerations:
- User balances from the old contract may need manual migration
- Consider creating a migration mechanism if users had deposits
- Communicate clearly about the transition to users

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Insufficient funds for gas"
**Solution:** Ensure at least 0.015 BNB in your Trezor address

### Issue: "Transaction rejected"
**Solution:** Check Trezor screen and confirm the transaction

### Issue: "Wrong network"
**Solution:** Switch MetaMask to BSC Mainnet (Chain ID: 56)

### Issue: "Account not found"
**Solution:** Reconnect Trezor to MetaMask and select correct account

### Issue: "Compilation failed"
**Solution:** Check Solidity version (0.8.22) and optimization settings

---

## üìû EMERGENCY CONTACT

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. **STOP** the deployment process
2. Do not proceed with compromised security
3. Double-check all addresses and configurations
4. Ensure Trezor device security before retrying

---

**üîê Remember: Your security is paramount. Take your time and verify each step.**

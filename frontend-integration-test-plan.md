## üìä Expected Results

### Withdrawal Split Scenarios:
1. **0 referrals**: 70% withdrawal / 30% reinvestment
2. **5+ referrals**: 75% withdrawal / 25% reinvestment  
3. **20+ referrals**: 80% withdrawal / 20% reinvestment
4. **Auto-compound enabled**: 0% withdrawal / 100% reinvestment

### Fee Calculation Example (100 USDT):
- **Withdrawal portion**: 70 USDT (for 0 referrals)
- **Admin fee (5%)**: 3.5 USDT (5% of 70, not 100)
- **User receives**: 66.5 USDT
- **Reinvestment**: 30 USDT

## üö® Critical Test Points
1. **Fee Logic**: Ensure 5% fee applies ONLY to withdrawal portion, not total amount
2. **Auto-Compound**: Verify it changes split to 0/100 and provides 5% bonus
3. **Treasury**: Confirm treasury wallet receives admin fees
4. **Help Pool**: Verify reinvestments go to Help Pool (except auto-compound)

## üìù Test Execution Notes
- Document any UI issues or inconsistencies
- Note performance of contract calls
- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify all calculations match expected business logic

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- All wallet connection flows work smoothly
- User data loads correctly from testnet contract  
- Withdrawal calculations are accurate per business rules
- Auto-compound toggle functions properly
- Error handling provides clear feedback
- UI is responsive and user-friendly

## üîÑ Post-Test Actions
1. Document any issues found
2. Fix any UI/calculation problems
3. Verify all enhanced functions work as designed
4. Prepare for mainnet deployment after successful testing

## üîê SECURITY GUARANTEES

### **Zero-Compromise Model:**
1. **Direct Trezor Ownership:** Contracts initialized with Trezor as owner/admin
2. **No Temporary Admin Rights:** Deployer key has NO admin privileges ever
3. **Immediate Security:** No ownership transfer period
4. **Hardware Wallet Control:** All admin functions require Trezor approval

### **Smart Contract Security:**
- **Ownable Contracts:** Both contracts inherit secure ownership model
- **Role-Based Access:** InternalAdminManager provides granular permissions
- **Upgrade Protection:** Only Trezor can authorize upgrades
- **Emergency Controls:** Emergency functions require Trezor signature

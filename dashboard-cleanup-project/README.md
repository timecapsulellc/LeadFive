# Dashboard Cleanup Project

## Overview

The Dashboard Cleanup Project aims to enhance the organization, integrity, and performance of the dashboard codebase. This project focuses on cleaning up the file structure, optimizing components, and ensuring a systematic approach to maintaining code quality.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **src**: Contains the source code for the dashboard application.
  - **components**: Reusable UI components categorized into common, layout, dashboard, and forms.
  - **pages**: Main pages of the application.
  - **services**: Services for API calls, authentication, and storage management.
  - **utils**: Utility functions and constants.
  - **hooks**: Custom hooks for managing state and side effects.
  - **styles**: CSS files for global styles and theming.
  - **types**: TypeScript type definitions for the project.
  - **App.tsx**: The main application component.

- **tests**: Contains unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code reliability.

- **scripts**: Utility scripts for project maintenance, including cleanup, analysis, and migration.

- **docs**: Documentation files detailing the architecture, component usage, and cleanup plans.

- **Configuration Files**: Includes ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, and npm configuration files.

## Goals

1. **Organize Components**: Ensure all components are properly categorized and documented.
2. **Optimize Code**: Refactor components for better performance and maintainability.
3. **Systematic Cleanup**: Implement a structured approach to remove unused files and code.
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for future reference and onboarding.

## Cleanup Process

1. **Audit Existing Code**: Review the current codebase to identify unused components and files.
2. **Refactor Components**: Optimize components for better performance and reusability.
3. **Organize File Structure**: Ensure a logical and consistent file structure across the project.
4. **Update Documentation**: Revise documentation to reflect changes made during the cleanup process.
5. **Testing**: Run tests to ensure that the cleanup process does not introduce any bugs.

## Conclusion

The Dashboard Cleanup Project is essential for maintaining a high-quality codebase that is easy to navigate and extend. By following the outlined goals and processes, we aim to create a more efficient and organized dashboard application.

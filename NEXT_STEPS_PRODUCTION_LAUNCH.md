### 1. **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT** ‚≠ê HIGHEST PRIORITY
```bash
# Deploy to BSC Mainnet using the production script
cd "/Users/dadou/Orphi CrowdFund"
npx hardhat run deploy-production-final.cjs --network bsc

# Alternative: Use testnet first for final validation
npx hardhat run deploy-production-final.cjs --network bscTestnet
```

**Requirements:**
- Ensure BSC Mainnet configuration in `hardhat.config.cjs`
- Have sufficient BNB for deployment gas fees
- Verify Trezor wallet address is accessible: `0xDf628ed21f0B27197Ad02fc29EbF4417C04c4D29`

### 2. **CONTRACT VERIFICATION** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
```bash
# Verify contract on BSCScan after deployment
npx hardhat verify --network bsc <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  "0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955" \
  "0xDf628ed21f0B27197Ad02fc29EbF4417C04c4D29" \

  "0xDf628ed21f0B27197Ad02fc29EbF4417C04c4D29"
```

### 3. **FRONTEND INTEGRATION** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
- Update frontend with new contract address
- Deploy updated frontend to production
- Test all user flows end-to-end

### 4. **INITIAL TESTING** ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Execute test transactions with small amounts
- Verify all admin functions work with Trezor wallet
- Test contribution, withdrawal, and reward claiming flows

### 5. **PLATFORM LAUNCH** ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Begin user onboarding
- Start marketing campaigns
- Monitor system performance

# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_deployment_private_key"
export NETWORK="bsc"

# Execute deployment
npx hardhat run deploy-production-final.cjs --network bsc
```

### 3. **Frontend Update**
```javascript
// Update contract address in frontend config
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "NEW_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS";
const ABI = require("./artifacts/contracts/OrphiCrowdFund.sol/OrphiCrowdFund.json").abi;
```

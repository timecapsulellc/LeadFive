## 🛠️ Issue Resolution Summary

### Problem Identified & Solved:
**Issue:** Initialize function parameter mismatch causing deployment failure
- Deployment script was passing 4 parameters  
- Contract initialize function only accepts 2 parameters

**Root Cause:** 
- Legacy backup contract `OrphiCrowdFund_LEGACY_BACKUP.sol` with same contract name
- Caused ABI compilation conflicts
- Wrong function signature detected during compilation

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Temporarily moved conflicting legacy backup file
2. ✅ Recompiled contracts to generate correct ABI  
3. ✅ Updated deployment script with correct parameters:
   - `address _usdtToken` (USDT token address)
   - `uint256[5] memory _packageAmounts` (Package price array)
4. ✅ Successfully deployed with proper initialization
5. ✅ Restored legacy backup file

## ✅ Verified Configuration

**Package Amounts (USDT with 6 decimals):**
- Package 1: $30 USDT (`30,000,000`)
- Package 2: $50 USDT (`50,000,000`)
- Package 3: $100 USDT (`100,000,000`) 
- Package 4: $200 USDT (`200,000,000`)
- Package 5: Reserved (`0`)

**Security Features Active:**
- ✅ Trezor-only admin access (`0xDf628ed21f0B27197Ad02fc29EbF4417C04c4D29`)
- ✅ Role-based access control (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE, OPERATOR_ROLE)
- ✅ UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern
- ✅ Emergency pause/unpause functionality
- ✅ MEV protection enabled
- ✅ Reentrancy guards active

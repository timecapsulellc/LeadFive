 * ║  Due to the complexity of integrating Trezor with Hardhat directly,                  ║
 * ║  we recommend a two-step secure deployment process:                                   ║
 * ║                                                                                       ║
 * ║  OPTION 1: Use Remix IDE with Trezor                                                 ║
 * ║  • Go to remix.ethereum.org                                                          ║
 * ║  • Connect your Trezor via "Injected Provider"                                       ║
 * ║  • Deploy contracts directly through Remix                                           ║
 * ║  • All transactions signed by Trezor                                                 ║
 * ║                                                                                       ║

 * ║  • Install Frame (frame.sh)                                                          ║

 * ║  • Use Frame as provider in Hardhat                                                  ║
 * ║  • Deploy with hardware wallet security                                              ║

Steps:
• Upload contracts/OrphiCrowdFund.sol
• Upload contracts/modules/InternalAdminManager.sol
• Compile both contracts
• Connect Trezor wallet
• Deploy InternalAdminManager first
• Deploy OrphiCrowdFund second
• Link them together

OPTION 2: FRAME + HARDHAT
========================
1. Install Frame: https://frame.sh
2. Connect your Trezor to Frame
3. Configure Hardhat to use Frame as provider
4. Run deployment script
5. All transactions signed by Trezor

OPTION 3: TEMP KEY + IMMEDIATE TRANSFER
=====================================

2. Deploy contracts with this script
3. IMMEDIATELY transfer all ownership to Trezor

# Archived Deployment Files Summary

**Date:** $(date)
**Total Files Archived:** $(find "$ARCHIVE_DIR" -type f | wc -l | xargs)

## What Was Replaced

All these scattered deployment scripts have been replaced with a single, unified deployment system:

\`\`\`bash
# New unified deployment commands:
npm run deploy testnet                 # Deploy to BSC Testnet
npm run deploy testnet --trezor        # Deploy to Testnet with Trezor
npm run deploy mainnet                 # Deploy to BSC Mainnet  
npm run deploy mainnet --trezor        # Deploy to Mainnet with Trezor
npm run deploy --check ADDRESS        # Check existing deployment
npm run deploy --estimate NETWORK     # Estimate gas costs
\`\`\`

## Benefits of New System

1. **Single Entry Point** - No more confusion about which script to use
2. **Consistent Interface** - Same commands for all deployments
3. **Better Security** - Trezor integration built-in
4. **Comprehensive Logging** - Professional deployment reports
5. **Gas Estimation** - Built-in cost calculation
6. **Error Handling** - Robust retry and validation
7. **Maintainable** - One file to maintain instead of 75+

## Archived File Categories

- **Root Deployment Scripts:** $(ls -1 $ARCHIVE_DIR/*.{js,cjs,mjs,sh} 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs) files
- **Scripts Directory:** $(ls -1 $ARCHIVE_DIR/scripts/*.{js,cjs,mjs,sh} 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs) files  
- **HTML Interfaces:** $(ls -1 $ARCHIVE_DIR/*.html 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs) files

## Migration Complete

The new unified deployment system (deploy.js) provides all functionality 
that was previously scattered across these files, with improved security,
better error handling, and professional-grade deployment management.
